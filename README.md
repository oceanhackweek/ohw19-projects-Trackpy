### Background

Understanding the underlying oceanographic drivers of the movements of pelagic marine organisms has been a major area of research interest for both primary and applied marine ecologists in recent years. Several recent studies leveraging animal tracking data and remotely-sensed oceanographic data have elucidated the importance of mesoscale oceanographic features, including eddies and filaments, to movements of highly-mobile pelagic organisms (e.g. Braun et al., 2019; Gaube et al., 2018; Abrahms et al., 2018). Open-source tools for linking such animal movements to oceanographic remote sensing data are of interest (see Dodge et al., 2013 for an R-based tool), yet simple tools for linking animal movements to databases of value-added mesoscale oceanographic features derived from remote sensing products are not readily available.


### Goals

Provide an illustrative example for Python beginners to link animal movement data with databases of mesoscale oceanographic features and visualize these interactions.

### Datasets

1. Simulated loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) satellite tag tracks.
