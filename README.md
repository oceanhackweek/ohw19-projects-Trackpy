### Background

Understanding the underlying oceanographic drivers of the movements of pelagic marine organisms has been a major area of research interest for both primary and applied marine ecologists in recent years. Several recent studies leveraging animal tracking data and remotely-sensed oceanographic data have elucidated the importance of mesoscale oceanographic features, including eddies and filaments, to movements of highly-mobile pelagic organisms (e.g. Braun et al., 2019; Gaube et al., 2018; Abrahms et al., 2018).
